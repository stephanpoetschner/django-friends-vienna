# Practical SSL for web devs 

*speaker:* [Stephan Pötschner](http://stephan-poetschner.at)

Disclaimer: I am no security expert. Any improvements/recommendations highly appreciated.

## Why?

* Protect our users!
    * Might be on insecure network (Wireless LAN).
    * Might look at sensitive data (being at work and look at new job offers).
    * Users tend to reuse their (weak) passwords over and over.
    * Traffic might be logged by third party (by the employer, by the provider,
      by the NSA, ...). As processing power increases, logged traffic might be decrypted.

* Protect yourself!
    * Hide your login credentials! [2nd most common attack vector][1]
    * Ever accessed your Django-Admin interface at a conference using the wireless network.

* It's your job! Leverage security by simply switching SSL on.
    * APIs for partners or mobile applications?
    * Making Man-In-the-Middle Attacks much harder.
    * It's a sane default.
        * [EFF recommends it.][2]
        * [Google Search sets SSL for logged-in users as default.][3]
        * [Facebook is doing it too][4]

## Simplified Steps

* Generate your key/certificate signing request.
* Pay official authority for validating your identity and for signing your certificate.
    * Certificates for free at [StartSSL][5], but horrible interface :)
* Chain your certificate with intermediate certificates from authorities.
* Deploy chained certificates and your private key
  at your front-end webserver (nginx, apache).
* Run [Qualsys SSL lab test][6].
* Customize [Django-Settings][7].
    * `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`: making `request.is_secure()` work.

            SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')

    * Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` to `True`.
      Basically disabling Cookies for HTTP. Otherwise could be leaked.
* Customize [frontend-server][8]
    * Add `X_FORWARDED_PROTO` header.
    * Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
    * Setup HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
      Simply adding a HTTP-header field, informing the browser that this domain
      must only be accessed with ssl.
      (`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`)
    * You could even contact browser vendors and add your HSTS policy to
      their [predefined list][9].

## Pitfalls

(most of them personally tested, while working on an API for mobile clients)

* Not enought testing! [Qualsys SSL lab test][6]
* Not including complete certificate chain.
    * Your desktop browser might download missing intermediate certificates.
    * Intermediate certificates might already be cached from other sites at your machine.
* If you are providing an API, your mobile applications might not automatically
  follow your graceful redirects from HTTP to HTTPS.
* Compression might/should be disabled due to possible information leakage.
    * SSL compression should be disabled: [CRIME attack][10]. Protecting your session cookie.
      nginx disables [SSL compression by default][11].
    * HTTP compression should also be disabled – [following your Django advice][12].
      This will protect your CSRF tokens.
* Using Server Name Indication (SNI – SSL without dedicated IP address)
  will work for [Android][13] 2.3+ – except when mobile developers use Apache HTTP Client library.
* Enforcing certificate validation.
  Your server-to-server calls might not validate SSL certificates:
    * Python 2.x: `urllib.urlopen`
      When opening HTTPS URLs, it does not attempt to validate the server certificate. Use at your own risk!
    * Use [`requests`-library][14]! (`verify=True` (default) or at least manually add certificate to trust chain!)
