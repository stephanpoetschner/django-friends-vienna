# Notes

* Google Cloud Endpoints is an additional layer between you application and
  the user – providing the actual API by interpreting a Discovery-Document.
* Needs Google App-Engine or Google Computing Engine as base-layer.
* provides interactive documentation (generates a Javascript based HTML-client for your api)
* Toolkit will also create clients for multiple languages (python, javascript, c#, ...).
  The same technology is used for Google's Public API.
* SSL-only API
* RESTful by-default
